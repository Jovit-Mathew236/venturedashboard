                    <b>Problem statements</b> <br />

                    1. According to estimates published by WHO, about one in three women have been subjected to partner or non-partner physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime. This problem requires technical solutions. Any idea that promotes women's safety is acceptable.
                    <br /><br />
                    2. Plastic is so widely used worldwide that it creates an enormous amount of waste. Besides negatively impacting the environment, this trash has several negative health effects. Hence, we encourage innovative solutions to limit plastic use.
